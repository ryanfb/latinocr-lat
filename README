You need wget, unzip and the Tesseract training tools to make this
training.

The following files have been automatically generated using the
tools in the grctraining git repository located at
  http://ancientgreekocr.org/grctraining.git

- training_text.txt
- grc.word.txt
- grc.freq.txt
- grc.unicharambigs

You can see the exact process for generating them in the grctraining
Makefile.

The Greek.unicharset file has been copied from training/langdata in
Tesseract's SVN repository.
